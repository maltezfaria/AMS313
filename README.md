# AMS313

*Some notes and notebooks for **AMS313***

## Installation

You will need a working version of `julia`, version `1.3` or higher (`1.5`
recommended). You will also need to install `jupyter`, or install `IJulia` which
will in turn install `jupyter` for you.

## Running the notebooks

Just launch `jupyter-notebook` from a terminal on the folder where the notebook
is, or launch `julia` and run `using IJulia` followed by the command
`notebook()`. This should launch a web browser where you can then `ctrl + enter`
the notebook cells in order to execute them.
